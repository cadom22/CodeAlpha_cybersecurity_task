# CodeAlpha_cybersecurity_task
I presented here a summary of the tasks I did during my Cybersecurity Internship at Code Alpha.

## Task1
I was given to build a network sniffer in Python that captures and analyses netrwork traffic. This essentially help me to understand how data flows on a network and how network packets are structured. By the way, I improve my Python knowledge, so nice !!!

## Task2
Here, it was about to educate people on phishing attacks, to help them recognizing and avoiding phishing emails, websites and social engineering tactics. I think it will be so useful.

## Task3
I was assigned to review the code of an application for security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for secure coding practices. For this I downloaded some OWASP documents which really show what I should do as an cybersecurity analyst when I'm in front of an application code. Particularly, I liked this task because it is the more near of what I'm projecting to do as profession.

## Task 4
Network Intrusion Detection System using Snort was not really easy but by hard working I think I will master that monitoring tool.

Thanks.
